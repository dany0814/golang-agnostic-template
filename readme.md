# 🚀 **GoFlex** *(The Agnostic Go Template)*  
**Production-ready Go template** for REST APIs, event-driven microservices, or anything in between. Built with **clean architecture (hexagonal), AWS SSM secrets, and pluggable transports** (Gin, NATS, gRPC, or your choice). Batteries included, opinions optional.  

### 🔥 **Why GoFlex?**  
✅ **Clean Architecture** – Decoupled domain, testable, and maintainable.  
✅ **Cloud-Native** – AWS SSM secrets, structured logging, and observability (OpenTelemetry/Prometheus).  
✅ **Protocol-Agnostic** – Start with REST (Gin), switch to NATS/Kafka, or go gRPC—**no rewrites**.  
✅ **Zero Lock-In** – Replace AWS SSM with Vault, Gin with Fiber, or NATS with RabbitMQ.  
✅ **DevOps-Ready** – Pre-configured CI/CD, Docker, and Makefile for instant productivity.  

### ⚡ **Quick Start**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/goflex  
cd goflex && make dev  
```  
*Set secrets in AWS SSM, and you’re live!*  

### 📦 **What’s Inside?**  
- Hexagonal design (ports/adapters)  
- CQRS, Dependency Injection, and more  
- Dynamic configs (dev/staging/prod)  
- Modular **event-driven** or **REST-first** setup  
- Example CRUD + JWT auth  

### 🌟 **Perfect For**  
- Launching scalable microservices **fast**  
- Learning clean architecture in Go  
- Projects demanding **flexibility without chaos**
